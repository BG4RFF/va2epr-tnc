@chapter Introduction

This manual describes the steps taken to create the VA2EPR Terminal
Node Controller. It covers everything from ordering components to
setting up and running the PC software. The goal is to provide a
set of instructions that could be used to rebuild and use the device.

@chapter Obtaining Materials

One of the design goals of the project was to choose generic parts
and materials such that it would be easy to find parts and part suppliers. This
chapter will describe where parts were obtained and provide general
information about the supplier.

@section Printed Circuit Boards (iTead Studio)

The printed circuit boards were fabricated by iTead Studio in
Shenzhen, China. The GERBER files provided on the website were
sent to iTead Studio.

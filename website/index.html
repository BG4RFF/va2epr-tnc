                Greetings and Salutations!
                My name is Thomas Cort.
                I live in <a href="http://www.ville.gatineau.qc.ca/">Gatineau</a>,
                <a href="http://www.gouv.qc.ca/">Quebec</a>,
                <a href="http://canada.gc.ca/">Canada</a> with my wife 
                Bridget. I am currently a student in the 
                <a href="http://www.cegep-heritage.qc.ca/Programs/Electronics/intro.htm">Electronics Technology</a>
                program at <a href="http://www.cegep-heritage.qc.ca/">Heritage College</a>.
                I'm in the final year of my studies, and I created this
                website to share my final year project with the world.
                The project incorporates one of my favourite hobbies,
                <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amateur_radio">Amateur Radio</a>.
		The goal is to design and build a
                <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terminal_node_controller">Terminal Node Controller</a>.
                Additionally, I'm going to be making a portable version with an integrated
                <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Global_Positioning_System">GPS</a> receiver.
                The target application of the portable version is 
                <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automatic_Packet_Reporting_System">APRS</a> tracking.
                If you would like to contact me, my e-mail address is

              <span class="h1">Current Status</span>
              <p>
                I've developed the schematic, a bill of materials, and a 
                printed circuit board layout. I've also tested portions 
                of the circuit and written some proof of concept
                code for the firmware. I've got the parts and enclosures
                ready to go; I'm just waiting on the printed circuit 
                boards to be manufactured. I'm just beginning to work on 
                this website and push things to
                <a href="https://github.com/tcort/va2epr-tnc">github</a>.
                I have a lot to add to the site, so check back often for
                updates.

              <p>
                Important documentation will be posted here. Currently,
                I have posted a detailed project proposal document outlining the
                scope of the project, the project goals, the preliminary design,
                and an implementation plan. In the future, I will be
                posting end of semester reports in this section as well
                as user manuals.

              <p>
                At the heart of the project is an Atmel ATMega1284p 
                microcontroller running at 14.7456MHz. Connected to it 
                are sub-circuits that interface with a radio, a 
                computer, and optionally a GPS. The computer interface 
                is USB (Mini B connector) using an FTDI FT232RL chip to 
                provide a virtual COM port in Windows which should 
                enable compatibility with existing KISS mode packet
                software while providing the convenience of USB. The 
                radio is interfaced with a DIN5 connector, somewhat 
                common among TNCs, to send/receive audio signals and key 
                the radio. Power is provided via a 2.1mm barrel 
                connector. Below is the schematic, bill of materials, 
                and printed circuit board artwork.

              <p>
                The firmware is a work in progress and so far it has 
                only been lightly tested. The purpose of the firmware 
                for right now is to test the major functionality of the 
                hardware on a breadboard to see if I can generate sine 
                waves, capture incoming signals, handle communications 
                with the PC and GPS, etc. It will likely be towards the 
                end of the semester, early December 2012, before
                it's ready for prime time.

              <p>
                There isn't much to the PC software at the moment since the 
                software is scheduled to be done during the second 
                semester (January 2013 to May 2013). The software will 
                likely be written in C++ using the Qt library.
                The software will be very involved. I'll be 
                implementing KISS, AX.25, APRS, and other 
                protocols. The text of the specifications for those protocols adds up to 
                over 200 pages. In addition, I'll be writing code 
                for the user interface, both a terminal emulator and
                a map based graphical user interface.

                This is an <i>Electronics Technology</i> <b>student 
                project</b>. I am <b>not</b> an engineer nor will I be 
                when I'm done school. The hardware/software has 
                <b>not</b> been verified/certified by anyone to do 
                anything or comply with any standards. It is a 
                prototype. It is provided "AS IS" and comes with no 
                warranty. I'm offering it here mainly for people who
                are interested in the technical side of Terminal Node 
                Controller design. What you see is what you get. I don't 
                sell kits nor any sort of products. This isn't a 
                business; it is a personal website about a student

                Greetings and Salutations!
                My name is <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_(name)">Thomas</a>,
                and I'd like to welcome you to my little pit stop on the information superhighway.
                I live in <a href="http://www.ville.gatineau.qc.ca/">Gatineau</a>,
                <a href="http://www.gouv.qc.ca/">Quebec</a>,
                <a href="http://canada.gc.ca/">Canada</a> with my wife Bridget.
                I am currently a student in the 
                <a href="http://www.cegep-heritage.qc.ca/Programs/Electronics/intro.htm">Electronics Technology</a>
                program at <a href="http://www.cegep-heritage.qc.ca/">Heritage College</a>.
                I'm in the final year of my studies, and I created this website to showcase my final year project.
                The project incorporates one of my favourite hobbies,
                <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amateur_radio">Amateur Radio</a>.
		The goal is to design and build a
                <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terminal_node_controller">Terminal Node Controller</a>
                (i.e. a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radio">radio</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modem">modem</a>).
                Additionally, I'm going to be making a portable version with an integrated
                <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Global_Positioning_System">GPS</a> receiver.
                The target application of the portable version is 
                <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automatic_Packet_Reporting_System">APRS</a> tracking.
                If you would like to contact me, my e-mail address is

              <span class="h1">Current Status</span>
              <p>
                I've created an initial schematic, a bill of materials, and I've ordered parts for bread boarding. I've
                also tested portions of the circuits and written some proof of concept
                code for the firmware. I'm just beginning to work on this website and push things to
                <a href="https://github.com/tcort/va2epr-tnc">github</a>. A formal project plan is being drafted, and
                work is beginning on the printed circuit board layout. I have a lot to add to the site, so
                check back often for updates.
              </p>

              <p>
                At the heart of the project is an Atmel ATMega1284p microcontroller running at 14.7456MHz. Connected to it are
                sub-circuits that interface with a radio, a computer, and optionally a GPS. The computer interface is USB (Mini B connector)
                using an FTDI FT232RL chip to provide a virtual COM port in Windows which should enable compatibility with existing KISS mode packet
                software while providing the convenience of USB. The radio is interfaced with a DIN5 connector, somewhat common among TNCs, to 
                send/receive audio signals and key the radio. Power is provided via a 2.1mm barrel connector. Below is the preliminary schematic
                and bill of materials.

              <span class="h1">Firmware</span>
              <p>
                The firmware is a work in progress and so far it has only been lightly tested. The purpose of the firmware for right now is
                to test the major functionality of the hardware on a breadboard to see if I can generate sine waves, capture incoming signals,
                handle communications with the PC and GPS, etc. It will likely be towards the end of the semester, early December 2012, before
                it's ready to go.

                There isn't much here at the moment since the software is scheduled to be done during the second semester (January 2013 to May 2013).
                I just have the CRC function for AX.25 written. The software will likely be written in C# and will be very involved. I'll
                be implementing KISS, AX.25, APRS, and possibly other protocols along with a terminal emulator and a graphical user interface.

                This is an <i>Electronics Technology</i> <b>student project</b>. I am <b>not</b> an engineer nor will I be when I'm done school.
                The hardware/software has <b>not</b> been verified/certified by anyone to do anything or comply with any standards.
                It is a prototype. It comes with no warranty. I'm offering it here mainly for educational purposes to people who
                are interested in the technical side of Terminal Node Controller design.
                What you see is what you get. I don't sell kits nor any sort of products. This isn't a business; it's a student project.

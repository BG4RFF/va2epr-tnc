Installing the firmware is fairly simple. Here's how I do it.

Install the Tools
-----------------

You will need to install avr-gcc and GNU make as well as avrdude.

Compile the Code
----------------

Run 'make' in this directory.

	$ make

Connect the Hardware
--------------------

I use the ATMEL AVR Dragon programmer's JTAG interface via USB to program
the microcontroller. If you have something different, you'll have
to change the avrdude settings in the Makefile.

Connect your programmer of choice to the computer and to board via the
board's JTAG connector. Apply power to the board

Program
-------

Run the following commands to set the fuses and program the EEPROM and flash.

	$ make write-fuses
	$ make write-eeprom
	$ make write-flash

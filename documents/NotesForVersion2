 * Redo schematic and pcb using a free / open source CAD program.
 * USB A connector for a stronger hold.
 * Smaller PCB to reduce costs (10cm x 5cm or smaller).
 * For the DAC, put DAC0 on PB0 (currently it's reversed DAC0 is on PB7)
 * Use an OpAmp package that has 2 op amps per package
 * Use a transistor as a switch to turn the gps on and off
 * Think about power saving options

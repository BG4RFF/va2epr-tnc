This software project is just getting started. The goal is to have a simple
interface for testing and debugging the firmware by sometime in December.
During the Winter/Spring, a lot of the remaining work, such as implementing
AX.25 and APRS, will get some attention. Until then, my focus will be on
the firmware and only the most fundamental features of the software.

As you have probably already realized, this software was written in C++
using the Qt libraries. I'm not sure what else to say here. At present,
everything is very straightforward and very little needs explaination.
When that changes, as I expect it to when I implement AX.25, I'll update
this file.

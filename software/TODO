This file provides a general list of specific tasks that
could and/or need to be done.

- Store application settings.

  * on first run, prompt user if user wants to
  access the internet for map feature.

- More appropriate names for SerialPort classes. The LinuxSerialPort
  class would likely work on any system with termios, so rename it to
  TermiosSerialPort. Similarly, the WindowsSerialPort class would likely
  work on other systems (ReactOS, wine, etc), so rename it to something
  less specific.

I generally tend to make a lot of small commits which results in a HUGE
changelog. Therefore, the ChangeLog has been omitted as it is easily
accessible via 'git'. Major changes from the last version are always
noted in the NEWS file. For those interested in every change, check out
the va2epr-tnc git repository commit log:
